## Project

Laravel 13 + Inertia + React + TypeScript + shadcn/ui.

This project is for learning Laravel and building random independent features. Features may be unrelated, so group files by feature inside Laravel's default folders.

## Main Pattern

Use Laravel-default structure with feature-based subfolders.

Default flow:

```txt
Route → Controller → FormRequest → Action/Service → Model → Resource/Data → Inertia Page/API Response
```

Use these patterns only when needed:

```txt
Validation      → FormRequest
Business logic  → Action
Reusable logic  → Service
Index/filter    → Query
Authorization   → Policy
Response shape  → Resource/Data
Shared helper   → Support
```

Do not create Repository classes by default. Use Eloquent directly unless there is a strong reason.

## Backend Structure

Group backend files by feature inside Laravel's default folders.

```txt
app/
├── Models/
│   └── FeatureName/
│
├── Http/
│   ├── Controllers/
│   │   └── FeatureName/
│   ├── Requests/
│   │   └── FeatureName/
│   └── Resources/
│       └── FeatureName/
│
├── Actions/
│   └── FeatureName/
│
├── Queries/
│   └── FeatureName/
│
├── Services/
│   └── FeatureName/
│
├── Policies/
│   └── FeatureName/
│
├── Data/
│   └── FeatureName/
│
└── Support/
```

Example:

```txt
app/Models/Post/Post.php
app/Http/Controllers/Post/PostController.php
app/Http/Requests/Post/StorePostRequest.php
app/Actions/Post/CreatePostAction.php
app/Queries/Post/PostIndexQuery.php
app/Services/Post/PostCoverService.php
app/Data/Post/PostData.php
```

## Route Structure

Routes must be separated by feature/module.

```txt
routes/
├── web.php
├── api.php
├── web/
│   ├── post.php
│   ├── pos.php
│   └── settings.php
└── api/
    ├── post.php
    ├── pos.php
    └── mobile.php
```

Use `routes/web/*.php` for Inertia/web routes.

Use `routes/api/*.php` for API/mobile/external routes.

Main route files should load feature route files:

```php
// routes/web.php
require __DIR__ . '/web/post.php';
require __DIR__ . '/web/pos.php';
require __DIR__ . '/web/settings.php';
```

```php
// routes/api.php
require __DIR__ . '/api/post.php';
require __DIR__ . '/api/pos.php';
require __DIR__ . '/api/mobile.php';
```

Do not rely on implicit route-model binding for mutable feature routes. For routes
that update, delete, pause, complete, duplicate, or otherwise mutate data, accept
the route parameter as a string in the controller and explicitly resolve the
record through the authenticated user's scoped relationship or an explicit query.
Return 404 when the scoped query cannot find the record.

When mutable routes resolve user-owned records, prefer ownership enforcement in
the query itself, for example `$request->user()->relation()->whereKey(...)`,
instead of fetching first and comparing owner IDs manually afterward. If a
manual identity check is still needed, never rely on strict comparison between
raw model attributes and auth IDs unless the model cast is explicit and aligned.

For every Eloquent model, add casts for integer foreign keys and counters such
as `user_id`, `created_by`, `updated_by`, `points_awarded`, or similar numeric
columns. This avoids environment-specific mismatches where MySQL returns `"6"`
while auth state provides `6`, which can break ownership checks and Inertia
flows in production.

## Database Structure

Group database files by feature.

```txt
database/
├── migrations/
│   └── feature_name/
├── seeders/
│   └── FeatureName/
└── factories/
    └── FeatureName/
```

Example:

```txt
database/migrations/post/
database/seeders/Post/
database/factories/Post/
```

## Frontend Structure

Group frontend files by feature.

```txt
resources/js/
├── features/
│   └── feature-name/
│       ├── pages/
│       ├── components/
│       ├── forms/
│       ├── hooks/
│       └── types.ts
│
├── components/
│   └── ui/
├── layouts/
├── lib/
└── types/
```

Only reusable global UI goes into shared `components`.

## Rule

Keep the structure close to Laravel defaults, but group each feature inside subfolders.

Do not create a root `app/Features` folder unless explicitly requested.
